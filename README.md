# Huffmann-Coding
Simulates Huffmann coding on two programs simultaneously and reduce the length of message thus sent. 

Now, this project actually simulates the working of huffmann data compression algorithm on two different programs which are independent from each other.

* First You have to open "make_code.py" where you will get a tkinter GUI to enter the string which has to be compressed and sent.
* Now, this entered string will get converted and sent with the huffmann tree.
* After that You have to open "break_code.py" which actually picksup the converted/compressed string and the respective tree.
* Now, it will convert it to the original string and gives the desired output.
* It provides us with an average compression of 0.55.
